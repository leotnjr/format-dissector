# format-dissector
Project overview
Experiments dissecting image file formats in C, exploring headers, pixels, and byte-level structures
Trying to understand file formats and how to trasform them for deeper knowledge data management and manipulation.
Experiment with raw data and have a solid foundation in how computers read and display information.

Current Goals
-Make the bmp_bytes.exe displain in console the bitmap file data and the pixel array values.
-Transform colored images in grayscale.
-Make a simple picture-to-ASCII generator as proof of concept.
-Transform a png file into a jpeg

display the data of each pixel is
